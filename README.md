# Raster Font Viewer
Welcome to the Raster Font Viewer. Here you can display almost any raster font in raw binary format.  Additionally, you can use the Computer Screen Emulator which will emulate a computer screen of an old computer and do more.

Hover any character of the selected font to get the ASCII value of it.  The default values of the `Input & Display` form can be modified in the `_config.yml` file.
